The time when I helped a stranger that I'm going to talk about is helping an old man use a smartphone, which was a coincidence during my stay in Beijing. And it really left a deep impression on me.

我想讲的一次帮助陌生人的经历是帮助一位老人使用智能手机，这是我在北京发生的一次巧合。这件事给我留下了深刻的印象。

In terms of when it happened, it was probably three months ago. To be specific, it was this summer vacation when I traveled to Beijing. I met the old man when I was visiting the Forbidden City, which is a famous tourist attraction located in the center area of Beijing. Moving on to whom I was with, I went to this place just by myself.

说起事情发生的时间，大概是三个月前。具体来说，是今年暑假我去北京旅游的时候。我是在游览位于北京市中心的著名旅游景点——故宫时，遇到了这位老人。说到我和谁在一起，我是一个人去的。

As for what I did, well, at the beginning, I saw an old man standing in the middle of the crowds, looking very panicky and confused. While I walked up to him and asked what I could do to help him, the old man told me that he didn't know how to use the smartphone to call his daughter, which made him so nervous. Finally, I helped him find his daughter's number and get in touch with his family, and the old man thanked me so many times, making me feel satisfied and cheerful.

至于我做了什么，一开始，我看到一位老人站在人群中间，显得非常慌张和困惑。当我走到他身边，询问我能帮他做些什么时，老人告诉我，他不知道如何使用智能手机给女儿打电话，这让他非常紧张。最后，我帮他找到了女儿的号码，并联系上了他的家人，老人连声道谢，让我感到很满足、很开心。

When it comes to how I felt, I mean, this was the first time that I felt so fulfilled after talking with a stranger. Through this experience, I knew how much I could do to help others. What's more, it also made me realize that helping the elderly is a way to build a better society.

说到我的感受，这是我第一次在与陌生人交谈后感到如此充实。通过这次经历，我知道了自己能为帮助他人做多少事。更重要的是，它还让我意识到，帮助老人是建设美好社会的一种方式。
